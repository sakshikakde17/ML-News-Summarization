            "The countrywide vaccination drive against COVID-19 on Sunday completed one year, during which over 156.76 crore vaccine doses were administered.  According to health ministry officials, over 93% of the adult population have received at least one dose while over 69.8% have been fully vaccinated.  A commemorative postage stamp on indigenously developed vaccine Covaxin was released to mark one year of the inoculation drive.  Earlier in the day, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, in a tweet, said that India crossed the landmark milestone of administering 10 crore vaccine doses on April 1 last year.  As many as 25 crore vaccine doses were administered on June 25, crossed 50 crore COVID-19 vaccine dose on August 6 and 75 crore on September 13, he said.\n",
